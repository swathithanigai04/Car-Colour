# **Car Colour Detection Model with Traffic Analysis**

This project is part of the internship assignment to develop an **AI-powered system** that detects car colors in traffic, counts the number of cars at a traffic signal, and identifies people present. It also provides a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for an interactive preview.

## **Features**

* Detects car colors using a **CNN model (MobileNetV2)**.
* Highlights **blue cars with red rectangles** and **other cars with blue rectangles**.
* Counts the number of cars and people at traffic signals.
* User-friendly **GUI for image preview and detection**.
* Provides model evaluation metrics: **Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall**.

## **Evaluation**

* Model accuracy: **78%**
* Metrics used:

  * **Confusion Matrix**
  * **Precision & Recall**

##  **Model File**

The trained model file `car_color_classifier.h5` is included in the repository.
Since the file size exceeds GitHub limits, download it from **\[Google Drive link]** (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GnLz31m5_tL1uXk2zcK5vyOj66iKv3dp/view?usp=sharing).

## **Technologies Used**

* **TensorFlow / Keras**
* **OpenCV**
* **NumPy, Pandas**
* **Matplotlib**
* **Tkinter** for GUI
